<b>eightQueens_FancyPrint</b><br> 
A program that uses pointers to print graphic solutions to the classic problem of how to place eight queens on a chessboard so that no queen is threatening any other. Uses a 1D array to represent the board, and makes use of the GOTO command to implement looping.

<b>eightCellCross</b><br>  
![alt text](http://i.imgur.com/inPvdwK.jpeg "8 Cell Cross") <br>
A program that allocates the integers 1-8 to the cells arranged as in the above figure, subject to
the restrictions that no two adjacent (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) cells contain consecutive integers.<br>
Uses the same backtracking scheme from the 8 Queens Problem solutions in this repository.<br>

<hr>

<b>eightQueens_1D</b><br> 
A program that prints all solutions to the classic problem of how to place eight queens on a chessboard so that no queen is threatening any other. Uses a 1D array to represent the board, and makes use of the GOTO command to implement looping.

<hr>

<b>eightQueens_1D_noGOTO</b><br>
A program that prints all solutions to the classic problem of how to place eight queens on a chessboard so that no queen is threatening any other. Uses a 1D array to represent the board, and specifically does not use the GOTO command to implement looping.

<hr>

<b>shiftEquivalent</b><br>
A function that tests if two 1D arrays of equal length are shift equivalent.
